_Collaborations with the Past: Reshaping Shakespeare Across Time and Media_  
Diana Henderson. November 14, 2006. Running time: 1:17:24

[MIT Metamedia Project](http://www.rrtn.org/adias2/platform/mit-metamedia): provides students and faculty with a flexible on-line environment to create, annotate and share media-rich documents for the teaching and learning of core humanistic subjects. Faculty can build subject-specific mini-archives to extend the use of multimedia materials in the classroom and thus further pedagogical innovation.

Based on open standards, the Metamedia framework allows the formation of learner communities across disciplines and distances and ensures interoperability with a wide range of current and future media resources.
